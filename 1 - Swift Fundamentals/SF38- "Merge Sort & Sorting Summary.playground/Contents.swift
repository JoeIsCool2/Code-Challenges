//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF38: "Merge Sort & Sorting Summary"
//  Concept: Review sorting algorithms and demonstrate a base level understanding of time complexity.

//  Instructions:
    //  Do some research on Merge Sort: üîóhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort
    //  Why is this sort more efficient than the other sorts we have learned?
    //  Why would we have you learn about sorting algorithms when there is a perfectly good .sort() function?
    //  Explain your answer in the /* */ comment marks below.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Include extra relevant information you learned in the black diamond challenges in your writing below.
    //  If you have not completed the other black diamond challenges, do those instead.

// MARK: Your response:

/*
 Merge Sorts are more efficient because it is a divide-and-conquer algorithm it does not do it all at once it breaks it up into smaller more reasonable sections and compairs those then it. It also is more efficient because it doesnt go over every value multiple times once it know that one value is bigger then the other it only needs to chekc it if the next value is bigger then the ones infrom of it.
 
 We need to learn about sorting algorithms so that we understand what is happeneing with the .sort method
