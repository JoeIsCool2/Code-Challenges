//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge ST14: "SFSymbol Lookup"
//  Concept: Practice creating ViewModifiers to create custom reusable view designs.

//  Instructions:
    //  In this simple challenge, all you need to do is create an app in which typing a symbol name into a textfield displays that symbol, along with a set of buttons that will change its color.
        //  To find symbol names, download the SF Symbols app: üîóhttps://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-5.1.dmg

//  Notes:
    //  To make sure the image displays correctly, you may need to add the .resizable(), .scaledToFit(), and .frame(width:) modifiers to your Image view.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Add a list view that searches all SFSymbol names and displays matches. You can get a list of symbol names from the SF Symbols app by displaying all symbols in a list view, selecting all, right clicking and choosing "copy names".
