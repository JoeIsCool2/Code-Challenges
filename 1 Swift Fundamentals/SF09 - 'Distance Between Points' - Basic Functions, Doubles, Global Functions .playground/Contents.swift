//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF9: "Distance Between Points"
//  Concept: Practice converting mathematical formulae into Swift functions, working with doubles, and using global functions or type methods for things like square roots and exponents

//  Instructions:
//      1) Create a function that finds the distance between two points on an x,y plane.
//          The function will take in 4 paramaters as doubles (x1,y1,x2,y2)
//          Will return the distance as a double
//          Most likely you do not know the formula for finding the distance between two points. Google it.

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
//    Create a struct called "Point" that holds the x and y values of each point, then use instances of Point to calculate the distance.
