//  üèîÔ∏è MTECH Code Challenge SF08: "Person Behaviors"
//  Concept: Practice creating structs, comparing two structs, and mutating struct values

//  Instructions:
    //  Create a Person value type with the following attributes and behaviors:
        //  Attributes: name, age, height, weight
        //  Behaviors:
            //  greeting: Print "Hello, my name is <name>, and I am <age> years old."
            //  birthday: Increase age by one
            //  growUp: Increase height by 0.1

//  ‚å∫ Black Diamond Challenge:
    //  Add a variable called bodyMassIndex. Set its initial value to 0. Assuming height is in meters and weight is in kilograms, write a mutating function that will update the Person's BMI based on their height.
